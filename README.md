# ü¶à Blahaj Rewrite

This repository contains rewrite of [blahaj](https://github.com/sech1p/blahaj) from TypeScript to C++.

I planned to rewrite blahaj to some compiled language from [some time](https://github.com/users/sech1p/projects/4?pane=issue&itemId=78622173). And there we go, you can see future version of blahaj here.

## ‚ùì Why C++ instead of Rust?

There are some reasons, why I use C++ instead of Rust, the main reason is that I don't know Rust, I never have to write smth in this language.

Second reason is strictly related to first reason, I just preffer writting in C++ which I know. Just all.

Remember that is this only concept, everything can be changed during development.

## ‚ùì FAQ

- This blahaj rewrite will be exactly same as original blahaj?

Yes, of course, I didn't have plans to make dramatical changes, all of syntax used in blahaj application will be the same as in original

- When rewrite will be released?

Honestly, i don't know, I don't always have time or mood to write code. Actually, I want to finish everything in OG blahaj

- Will this rewrite replace OG blahaj?

I'm not sure if i should keep legacy version of blahaj and rewrite in the same time (e.g. maintaining Python 2 and 3 in same time wasn't a good idea)

I will think about this, but now it's kinda far to make a verdict

## üîß Building

You must have installed [meson](https://mesonbuild.com), and C++ compiler (gcc or clang)

```sh
$ meson build
$ cd build
$ ninja
```

Now blahaj is builded into `blahaj` executable in `build/` folder
